## The Game

Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is a sequel to [Defense of the Ancients (DotA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's [Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos) and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.
